## Unix or GNU/Linux 
### (honestly just skip this part, I'm just going on a huge tangent about how I got into linux)

I grew up using MacOS as a kid. Blah Blah Blah, family computer nonsense. Unix was cool, MacOS's UI has always been the best since OSX released. Beautiful backgrounds, simple, thoughtful design choices. Amazing OS. It's overpriced tho, and that's just not cool. Either way, I've been using linux for almost a year now. Started out on Ubuntu like most people did before Mint, Zorin, & PopOS got big. It was fine until I got stuck on something, can't remember if it was wifi drivers not working anymore or something else. I started Distro hopping, trying out literally everything under the sun, anything that would run on my craptop. Puppy, Void, Linux Lite, anything I could get my hands on, I had a library full of ISOs at some point. I had an addiction to VMs aswell. at one point I riced debian to look like Windows XP out of spite. At some point I installed Arch Linux on my PC and I grew accustomed to it. I like having a rolling release that provides me with the newest releases. Although it's a little unstable, I'm getting used to it.
