## Computers
### (honestly just skip this part, I'm just going on a huge tangent about what I prefer)

I grew up using MacOS as a kid. Blah Blah Blah, family computer nonsense. If I had to chose I would rather use anything Unix based than use Windows. It's harder to program on. It's filled with bloat. It runs slow as hell on any budget laptop. I would rather use Linux any day. I don't care much for Video Games so I literally have no need for Windows, I don't care for it that much either since the games I do play are all mostly linux compatable.

2020 was the first year I actually got my first ever personal desktop. Like my own machine. I picked out the parts myself and plan on upgrading to better stuff down the line. I prefer AMD since their drivers are open-source and more compatable with Linux systems,like mine. I'll also end up getting a bit of a preformence boost once I get an AMD GPU after the prices drop
