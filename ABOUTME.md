# Hello :)
_If you're reading this then you probably decided to look into that weird repo no one usually checks. This is mostly just filled with basic information about me. Nothing really important other than my Aliases, Gender, what i do for a living, etc._
____
## Aliases
I don't really want to leak my real name out of fear so I'll give you some aliases I'm known by on the internet.

-  Parker
-  Oka

those are the main 2 when it comes to recognising me anywhere.
____
## LGBTQ+

- I'm currently questioning my gender (again)
- My pronouns are They/Them She/Her, use whichever one you like.
    - I don't really care as long as you get them right.
- My sex and sexuality are private information
    - You simply don't need to know, it's private info and you should respect that
____
## Work

- I'm currently unemployed.
    - Currently looking for a job so I can actually start paying for my own stuff
- I haven't had a "real" job yet
____
## Experience

- Everything I'm familiar with coding in is publicly available, here, on my github.
    - HTML
    - CSS
    - JS
    - SHELL
    - C++
- I've been activly coding for almost a year now.

____
## Computers
I (obviously) like computers.
